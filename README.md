# Get Your Guide Home Test

Here is the home test for Get Your Guide

## Getting Started

In order to see the live site, nodejs is required.

## Installing
Nodejs should be available on the computer. Please download it here https://nodejs.org/en/download.

After nodejs is installed, run the following command to install all node packages of the project, always on the root folder:

```
npm install
```

## Live View
In order to view the site locally, run the following command:

```
npm start
```

## Features
 - When the site initially loads, special offers will be available for the client to get the attention on the site.

 - The banner with the legend "See Our Specials Offers" will show and will be animated on the initial load to get the attention of the user.

 - All searches are showing in order, first the Special Offers so the client will have the best offer beforehand.

 - When a search is not returning any activities, a banner with the legend "No results available, but take a look at this Specials Offers." will display and showing the special offers. This helps the client be aware of other options.

 - The background image will be different each time the site loads, this will get the user attention on activities to do.

## Why the technologies used

### ReactJs & Redux
It was a good option to choose it because we have components that can be reused in other sections also we have a fast load of the dom on the search results and using Redux, development is done by thinking on what actions are required and what data will affect by those actions.
